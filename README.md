This is the github repository for our publication “Modelling eye-level
visibility of urban green space: Optimising city-wide point-based
viewshed computations through prototyping”. Here we provide reproducible
workflows for our analyses. Data supporting this publication is
accessible via the following DOI
([10.5281/zenodo.6421423](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6421423)).

## Installation

You can install protoVS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("STBrinkmann/protoVS")
```

## Workflows

#### 1. Data

The elevation data required downloading and pre-processing. In the
<a href="docs/workflows/00_Data/README.md">data workflow</a> we have
provided R scripts that describe the complete process. Processed input
data has also been uploaded on Zenodo for easy access.

#### 2. Evaluation

Reproducible workflows have been provided for the sections
<a href="docs/workflows/04_1_Experiment_Viewshed/README.md">4.1
Viewshed</a> and
<a href="docs/workflows/04_2_Experiment_VGVI/README.md">4.2 Greenness
visibility</a>.
